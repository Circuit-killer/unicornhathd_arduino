# Unicorn HAT HD for Arrrrrrduino

This might be useful for anyone who wants to connect a Pimoroni Unicorn HAT HD to an Arduino. I've tested this on a Teensy 3.2 only.

Note for reading the pins — pin 39/40 are closest to the pirate. Odd number pins are closer to the pirate, even number pins are towards the board edge.
